var c = 1 + 2 +3;
var t = true;
var arr = [2,5,1,4];
var h =function(){};
```

``` var ``` - common variable that can be reassigned but only accessed within a function.

``` const ``` - var which cannot be reassigned. 

``` let ``` - var that can be reassigned but declared only once in the code

``` var wahad = true ``` boolean

``` var vornachname = {vorname:"Mo", nachname:"Vie"} ``` object

``` undefined, null, Infinty ``` special

#### operators

```
a = b + x - z;
a = b * (x / y);
x = 100%21;
i++; j++;
```

##### logical operators

``` & ``` and

``` | ``` or

``` ~ ``` not

``` ^ ``` xor

###### arithmetic operator

``` a * (b+c); ``` grouping

``` attribute.object ``` member

``` object[arrval] ```member

``` !(t == f) ``` logical not

``` a != b ``` not equal

``` x === y ``` strict equal

``` x !== y ``` string unequal

``` typeof obj ``` type (number, object, function)

``` x < y ``` ``` x > y ``` less and greater than

``` z <= g ``` ``` z => g ``` less or equal, greater or equal

``` x += y``` this will be x = x + y ``` 2 += 5 ``` this equal 7

``` a && b ``` logical and ``` b || c ``` logical or
